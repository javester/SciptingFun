# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

# search blobs in storage account and change any found in 'archive' tier to 'cool' tier.
# useful if needing to azcopy the data to another storage account as operations can't be done against archived blobs

# down and dirty script - no error checking or catching.  Assumes all required permissions exist etc
# tested on a storage account with 20k blobs in container and it used approx 16gb of ram on a VM!!!
# Use at your own risk!!! This is likely not the best way to do this but it works if you don't have a lot of blobs!
